General:
========
* Fix internally-created faults lacking an XML element name (so e.g. toXml() would abort)
* KDSoapMessage::messageAddressingProperties() is now correctly filled in when receiving a message with WS-Addressing in the header

Client-side:
============
* Add support for timing out requests (default 30 minutes, configurable with KDSoapClientInterface::setTimeout())
* Add support for soap 1.2 faults in faultAsString()
* Improve detection of soap 1.2 faults in HTTP response
* Stricter namespace check for Fault elements being received
* Report client-generated faults as SOAP 1.2 if selected
* Fix error code when authentication failed
* Autodeletion of jobs is now configurable (github pull #125)
* Add error details in faultAsString() - and the generated lastError() - coming from the SOAP 1.2 detail element.
* Fix memory leak in KDSoapClientInterface::callNoReply
* Add support for WS-UsernameToken, see KDSoapAuthentication
* Extend KDSOAP_DEBUG functionality (e.g. "KDSOAP_DEBUG=http,reformat" will now print http-headers and pretty-print the xml)
* Add support for specifying requestHeaders as part of KDSoapJob via KDSoapJob::setRequestHeaders()
* Rename the missing KDSoapJob::returnHeaders() to KDSoapJob::replyHeaders(), and provide an implementation
* Make KDSoapClientInterface::soapVersion() const

Server-side:
============
* New method KDSoapServerObjectInterface::additionalHttpResponseHeaderItems to let server objects return additional http headers.
  This can be used to implement support for CORS, using KDSoapServerCustomVerbRequestInterface to implement OPTIONS response,
  with "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" in the headers of the response (github issue #117).
* Don't generate two job classes with the same name, when two bindings have the same operation name. Prefix one of them with the binding name (github issue #139 part 1)
* Prepend this-> in method class to avoid compilation error when the variable and the method have the same name (github issue #139 part 2)

WSDL parser / code generator changes, applying to both client and server side:
================================================================
* Source incompatible change: all deserialize() functions now require a KDSoapValue instead of a 
    QVariant. If you use a deserialize(QVariant) function, you need to port your code to use 
    KDSoapValue::setValue(QVariant) before deserialize()
* Source incompatible change: all serialize() functions now return a KDSoapValue instead of a 
    QVariant. If you use a QVariant serialize() function, you need to port your code to use 
    QVariant KDSoapValue::value() after serialize()
* Source incompatible change: xs:QName is now represented by KDQName instead of QString, which 
    allows the namespace to be extracted. The old behaviour is available via KDQName::qname().
* Fix double-handling of empty elements
* Fix fault elements being generated in the wrong namespace, must be SOAP-ENV:Fault (github issue #81).
* Added import-path argument for setting the local path to get (otherwise downloaded) files from.
* Added -help-on-missing option to kdwsdl2cpp to display extra help on missing types.
* Added C++17 std::optional as possible return value for optional elements.
* Added -both to create both header(.h) and implementation(.cpp) files in one run
* Added -namespaceMapping @mapping.txt to import url=code mappings, affects C++ class name generation
* Added functionality to prevent downloading the same WSDL/XSD file twice in one run
* Added "hasValueFor{MemberName}()" accessor function, for optional elements
* Generated services now include soapVersion() and endpoint() accessors to match the setSoapVersion(...) and setEndpoint(...) mutators
* Added support for generating messages for WSDL files without services or bindings
* KDSoapValue now stores the namespace declarations during parsing of a message and writes 
    namespace declarations during sending of a message
* Avoid serialize crash with required polymorphic types, if the required variable wasn't actually provided
