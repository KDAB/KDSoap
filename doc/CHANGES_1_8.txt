General:
========
* Fix internally-created faults lacking an XML element name (so e.g. toXml() would abort)

Client-side:
============
* Add support for timing out requests (default 30 minutes, configurable with KDSoapClientInterface::setTimeout())
* Add support for soap 1.2 faults in faultAsString()
* Improve detection of soap 1.2 faults in HTTP response
* Stricter namespace check for Fault elements being received
* Report client-generated faults as SOAP 1.2 if selected
* Fix error code when authentication failed
* Autodeletion of jobs is now configurable (github pull #125)
* Add error details in faultAsString() - and the generated lastError() - coming from the SOAP 1.2 detail element.
* Fix memory leak in KDSoapClientInterface::callNoReply

Server-side:
============
* New method KDSoapServerObjectInterface::additionalHttpResponseHeaderItems to let server objects return additional http headers.
  This can be used to implement support for CORS, using KDSoapServerCustomVerbRequestInterface to implement OPTIONS response,
  with "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" in the headers of the response (github issue #117).
* Don't generate two job classes with the same name, when two bindings have the same operation name. Prefix one of them with the binding name (github issue #139 part 1)
* Prepend this-> in method class to avoid compilation error when the variable and the method have the same name (github issue #139 part 2)

WSDL parser / code generator changes, applying to both client and server side:
================================================================
* Fix double-handling of empty elements
* Fix fault elements being generated in the wrong namespace, must be SOAP-ENV:Fault (github issue #81).
* Added import-path argument for setting the local path to get (otherwise downloaded) files from.
* Added -help-on-missing option to kdwsdl2cpp to display extra help on missing types.
