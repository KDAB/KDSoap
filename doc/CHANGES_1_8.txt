General:
========
*

Client-side:
============
* Add support for soap 1.2 faults in faultAsString()
* Improve detection of soap 1.2 faults in HTTP response
* Stricter namespace check for Fault elements being received
* Report client-generated faults as SOAP 1.2 if selected
* Fix error code when authentication failed

Server-side:
============
* New method KDSoapServerObjectInterface::additionalHttpResponseHeaderItems to let server objects return additional http headers.
  This can be used to implement support for CORS, using KDSoapServerCustomVerbRequestInterface to implement OPTIONS response,
  with "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" in the headers of the response (github issue #117).

WSDL parser / code generator changes, applying to both client and server side:
================================================================
* Fix double-handling of empty elements
* Fix fault elements being generated in the wrong namespace, must be SOAP-ENV:Fault (github issue #81).
* Added import-path argument for setting the local path to get (otherwise downloaded) files from
