General:
========

Client-side:
============
* Add support for selecting WS-Addressing namespace for send messages
* Add support for implementing SOAP-over-UDP clients (see KDSoapUdpClient)

Server-side:
============

WSDL parser / code generator changes, applying to both client and server side:
================================================================
* Add override indicator to generated files. This requires c++11 for users of generated files.
* Remove all special handling of soap/encoding namespace, which fixes the use of soapenc:string and soapenc:integer for instance (#179).
