These are the instructions for installing KD SOAP using the CMake buildsystem.
CMake version 3.0.2 or higher is required.

KD SOAP 1.9 or below requires Qt version >= 4.6 with Network and XML support enabled.
KD SOAP 1.10 or above requires Qt version >= 5.7 with Network and XML support enabled.

Please see the comments at the top of CMakeLists.txt for
the available configuration options you can pass to cmake.

The installation directory defaults to c:\KDAB\KDSoap-<version> on Windows
and /usr/local/KDAB/KDSoap-<version> on non-Windows.  You can change this
location by passing the option -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path to cmake.

1) From the top directory of your KD SOAP installation create a build directory:

     mkdir build

   and change directory into that build directory:

     cd build

2) Now run 'cmake' depending on the kind of build one of the following:
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
     cmake -DKDSoap_STATIC=True -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
     cmake -DKDSoap_STATIC=True -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

   To define the install-location use for example:
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:/kdsoap ..
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/kdsoap ..

3) Unix

   set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your KD SOAP installation lib directory.

   If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already, then in your terminal run:
    % LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdsoap/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   The above must be added into your .bashrc or similar to remain. It may also of course
   be run from a shell just before building software using KD SOAP, but in this case
   your settings will only be available for this shell.

4) MacOS

   Proceed as described above, but using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

5) Windows

   For running executables, add the path to the KD Soap dll (kdsoap\bin) into your PATH.
   eg. set PATH=\path\to\kdsoap\bin;%PATH%

   For development, add the path to the KD Soap lib (kdsoaplib) into your LIB environment.
   eg. set LIB=\path\to\kdsoap\lib;%LIB%

6) Build everything by typing:

   From your top-level KD SOAP directory run:

   % make    # Unix, Mac
   % nmake   # Windows

7) (optionally:) Install KD SOAP:

   From your top-level KD SOAP directory run:

   % make install   # Unix, Mac
   % nmake install  # Windows

   This will copy the necessary files into the sub-directories of your installation path:
   For Unix/Linux, Mac this is /usr/local/KDAB/KDSoap-VERSION/
   For Windows this is: C:\KDAB\KDSoap-VERSION\

8) Have a look at the examples applications. They will get you started with KD SOAP.

== Testing ==
To build the testing harness, pass -DKDSoap_TESTS=true to CMake, like so:
  % cmake -DKDSoap_TESTS=true

Then run 'make test' to run the unit tests.
