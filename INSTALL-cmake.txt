These are the instructions for installing KD SOAP using the CMake buildsystem.
CMake version 2.8.7 or higher is required.

KD SOAP 1.x requires a Qt version >= 4.6 with Network and XML support enabled.

The same source code compiles with either Qt 4 or Qt 5.

1) From the top directory of your KD SOAP installation create a build directory:

     mkdir build

   and change directory into that build directory:

     cd build

2) Now run 'cmake' depending on the kind of build one of the following:
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
     cmake -DKDSOAP_STATIC=True -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
     cmake -DKDSOAP_STATIC=True -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

   To define the install-location use for example:
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:/kdsoap ..
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/kdsoap ..

3) Unix

set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your KD SOAP installation lib directory.

If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already then use this line:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdsoap/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The above has to be added into your .bashrc or similar to remain. It may also of course be run from a shell just before building software using KD SOAP, but in this case your settings will only be available for this shell.

4) MacOS

Proceed as described above, but using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead
of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

5) Windows

Add the path to KD SOAP lib into your LIB environment variable and the path
to KD SOAP bin into your PATH environment variable.

Or run:
  set PATH=\path\to\kdsoap\bin;%PATH%
  set LIB=\path\to\kdsoap\lib;%LIB%


6) Build everything by typing:

make    # Unix,
nmake   # Windows


7) (optionally:) Install KD SOAP:

   From your top-level KD SOAP directory just type

make install   # Unix,
nmake install  # Windows

   This will copy the necessary files into the sub-directories of
   your installation path:
   For Unix/Linux, Mac: /usr/local/KDAB/KDSoap-VERSION/
   For Windows that is: C:\KDAB\KDSoap-VERSION\


8) Symbian (Qt4 only)

A CMake build is not available for Symbian platforms.  Refer to the INSTALL.txt
file for instructions on using autotools for a Symbian install.


9) Have a look at the examples applications. They will get you started with KD SOAP.

== Testing ==
To build the testing harness, pass -DKDSoap_TESTS=true to CMake, like so:
  % cmake -DKDSoap_TESTS=true

Then run 'make test' to run the unit tests.

== Force a Qt4 build ==
On systems with both Qt4 and Qt5 available, the CMake buildsystem will always
attempt to use Qt5. To force a Qt build, pass -DKDSoap_ENFORCE_QT4_BUILD=true
to CMake, as in:
  % cmake -DKDSoap_ENFORCE_QT4_BUILD=true
