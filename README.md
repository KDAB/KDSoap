# Introduction

KD Soap is a Qt-based client-side and server-side SOAP component.

It can be used to create client applications for web services and also provides
the means to create web services without the need for any further component such
as a dedicated web server.

KD Soap targets C++ programmers who use Qt in their applications.

For more information, see <https://www.kdab.com/development-resources/qt-tools/kd-soap>

Qt6 support is added starting with KD Soap version 2.0, and requires
