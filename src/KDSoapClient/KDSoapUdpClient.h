/**
 * \brief KDSoapUdpClient provides an interface for implementing a [SOAP-over-UDP](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-dd/soapoverudp/1.1/os/wsdd-soapoverudp-1.1-spec-os.html) client.
 * 
 * One-way SOAP-over-UDP can be send by simply using sendMessage().
 * 
 * Request-response SOAP-over-UDP is supported by bind()ing to a sender UDP 
 * port.  You can send the request using sendMessage() and the response will is
 * signaled using receivedMessage(). receivedMessage() will signal any response, 
 * including those of other requests, there is no help with finding the correct 
 * response. The WS-Addressing properties of the message can be used to filter 
 * the received responses.
 * 
 * \code
 * auto soapUdpClient = new KDSoapUdpClient(this);
 * connect(soapUdpClient, &KDSoapUdpClient::receivedMessage, [=](const KDSoapMessage &message, const KDSoapHeaders &headers, const QHostAddress &address, quint16 port) { 
 *   if(message.messageAddressingProperties().action() == QStringLiteral("http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-dd/ns/discovery/2009/01/ProbeMatches")) {
 *     TNS__ProbeMatchesType probeMatches;
 *     probeMatches.deserialize(message);
 *     qDebug() << "Received probe match from" << address;
 *   }
 * });
 * soapUdpClient->bind(3702);
 * 
 * TNS__ProbeType probe;
 *
 * KDSoapMessage message;
 * message = probe.serialize(QStringLiteral("Probe"));
 * message.setUse(KDSoapMessage::LiteralUse);
 * message.setNamespaceUri(QStringLiteral("http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-dd/ns/discovery/2009/01"));
 *
 * KDSoapMessageAddressingProperties addressing;
 * addressing.setAction(QStringLiteral("http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-dd/ns/discovery/2009/01/Probe"));
 * addressing.setMessageID(QStringLiteral("urn:uuid:") + QUuid::createUuid().toString(QUuid::WithoutBraces));
 * addressing.setDestination(QStringLiteral("urn:docs-oasis-open-org:ws-dd:ns:discovery:2009:01"));
 * addressing.setReplyEndpointAddress(KDSoapMessageAddressingProperties::predefinedAddressToString(KDSoapMessageAddressingProperties::Anonymous));
 * message.setMessageAddressingProperties(addressing);
 *
 * soapUdpClient->sendMessage(message, KDSoapHeaders(), QHostAddress("239.255.255.250"), 3702);
