/**
 * The KDSoapPendingCallWatcher class provides a convenient way for waiting for
 * asynchronous replies.
 *
 * KDSoapPendingCallWatcher provides the finished() signal that will be emitted
 * when a reply arrives.
 *
 * It is usually used like the following example:
 * \code
 *  KDSoapPendingCall pendingCall = client.asyncCall(QLatin1String("MethodName"), message);
 *  KDSoapPendingCallWatcher *watcher = new KDSoapPendingCallWatcher(pendingCall, this);
 *
 *  QObject::connect(watcher, SIGNAL(finished(KDSoapPendingCallWatcher*)),
 *                   this, SLOT(slotFinished(KDSoapPendingCallWatcher*)));
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note It is not necessary to keep the original KDSoapPendingCall object
 * around since KDSoapPendingCallWatcher inherits from that class too.
