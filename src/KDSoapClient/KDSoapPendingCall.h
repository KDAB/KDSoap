 * without waiting for a reply.
 * KDSoapPendingCall is an opaque type, meant to be used as a handle for a pending reply.
 *
 * The KDSoapPendingCallWatcher class allows one to connect to a signal that will
 * indicate when the reply has arrived or if an error occurred.
 *
 * \note If you create a copy of a KDSoapPendingCall object, all information will
 * be shared among the many copies. Therefore, KDSoapPendingCall is an
 * explicitly-shared object and does not provide a method of detaching the copies
 * (since they refer to the same pending call)
