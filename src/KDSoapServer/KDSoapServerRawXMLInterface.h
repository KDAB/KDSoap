/**
 * Additional interface for processing incoming XML directly, without the use of KDSoapMessage.
 *
 * In addition to deriving from KDSoapServerObjectInterface, you can derive from
 * KDSoapServerRawXMLInterface in order to handle XML as it comes in.
 *
 * Use Q_INTERFACES(KDSoapServerRawXMLInterface) in your derived class (under Q_OBJECT)
 * so that Qt can discover the additional inheritance.
 *
 *
 * This can be useful for pre-processing invalid XML, or for handling very large requests
 * (received in chunks) in an incremental way, saving memory compared to the usual buffering
 * of the entire request.
 *
 * KDSoapServer will receive all HTTP headers, call newRequest(),
 * call processXML() for every chunk of XML, and finally call endRequest().
 * Use writeHTTP() or writeXML() (from KDSoapServerObjectInterface) to reply back.
 *
 * \since 1.5
