/**
 * Base class for server objects, i.e. objects implementing the methods
 * that can be called by SOAP clients.
 *
 * Your server object must derive from both QObject (directly or indirectly)
 * and from KDSoapServerObjectInterface.
 * The virtual method processRequest is called whenever a SOAP request is being made.
 * To handle the call, either reimplement processRequest and do the dispatching
 * manually (not recommended), or use kdwsdl2cpp to generate the base class for your server object.
 *
 * Example:
  <code>
  class EmployeeServerObject : public MyServerBase // base class generated from the wsdl file
  {
    Q_OBJECT

  public: // methods published to SOAP
    QString getEmployeeCountry(const QString& employeeName);
    [...]
  };
  </code>
 *
 * The generated base class provides the pure virtual methods for each method
 * defined in the WSDL file, such as getEmployeeCountry() in this example,
 * as well as a generated processRequest() method which calls getEmployeeCountry
 * when parsing a KDSoapMessage that is a "getEmployeeCountry" request.
 *
 * Multi-threading note: KDSoapServer will create one instance of a "server object"
 * per thread. So the code in this class does not need to be protected for thread-safety.
 * Make sure to protect any shared resources though.
