General:
========
* C++11 is now required. Qt4 is still supported, but this is the last release with support for Qt4.
* Fix rpath for Unix/Linux/macOS (#181).
* Improve cmake usage by setting the install interface directories on the library targets (#196).
  You can just link to KDSoap::kdsoap and you'll get the correct include paths now.
* New installing file for Conan (WIP - see conan folder)

In release 1.9.1:
-----------------
* Restore previous EULA (LICENSE.txt and LICENSE.US.txt)
* remove unittests: onvif_org_event, onvif_ptz, onvif.org WSDL
* Fix static linking examples and unittests in the CMake buildsystem
* small buildsystem improvements

Client-side:
============
* Add support for selecting WS-Addressing namespace for send messages (#176).
* Fix WS-Addressing spec compliance (#193)
* Add support for implementing SOAP-over-UDP clients (see KDSoapUdpClient).

Server-side:
============

WSDL parser / code generator changes, applying to both client and server side:
================================================================
* Add override indicator to generated files. This requires c++11 for users of generated files.
* Add option for loading PKCS12 certificates (#190).
* Remove all special handling of soap/encoding namespace, which fixes the use of soapenc:string and soapenc:integer for instance (#179).
* Fix compilation error due to missing QSharedPointer include in generated code (#170).

Examples:
========
* The holidays examples have been replaced with bank-lookup examples. Less fun, but the holidays web service no longer exists...
